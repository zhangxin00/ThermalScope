# ThermalScope

This repository contains the experiments of evaluation and case studies discussed in the paper  
* "ThermalScope: A Practical Interrupt Side Channel Attack Based On Thermal Event Interrupts" (DAC 2024).
  
ThermalScope distinguishs a new interrupt side channel. Our key observation is that workloads running on CPUs inevitably generates their distinct heat, which can be correlated with the thermal event interrupts.
